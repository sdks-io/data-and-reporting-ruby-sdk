# Priced Transactions

This API allows querying transaction data (i.e. Priced, Billed and Unbilled sales items). It provides a flexible search criteria and supports paging.

Transactions that are posted but not yet priced, billed or that are in error will not be returned by this API. The API also supports returning Fee Items.

#### Supported operations

* Get sales items and fee transactions
  * Search by invoice status
  * Search by fixed date period
  * Search by date range
  * Search by account
  * Search by card
* Get sales items only
  * Search by transaction Id or location
  * Search by transaction posting date
  * Search by invoice number or date
  * Search by driver name or vehicle registration number
  * Search by card group
  * Search by fuel only transactions
  * Search by product

This API fetches transactions for a period based on the below parameters and priority order:

1. InvoiceNumber
2. InvoiceDate
3. FromDate, ToDate
4. PostingFromDate, PostingToDate (Can be used only when IncludeFees = false)
5. InvoiceDateFrom, InvoiceDateTo
6. Period

This API considers only one of the above set of parameters at a time. For example, if InvoiceNumber and Period are provided in the input then Period is ignored and transactions associated to the given invoice number are returned.

If none of the above parameters are provided then last 7 days transactions will be fetched.

This operation can fetch transactions that are old up to 24 (configurable) months. However, the date range between any of the ‘From’ and ‘To’ dates in the above combination cannot be more than 210 (configurable) days.

def priced_transactions(request_id,
                        body: nil)
```
